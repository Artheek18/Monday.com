# Monday.com
This Python project automates sending emails by integrating Monday.com and SendGrid. It retrieves email addresses and corresponding content from a specified Monday.com board and sends personalized emails using the SendGrid API. The script can be scheduled to run every 4 hours from Monday to Friday using Railway CI/CD.
